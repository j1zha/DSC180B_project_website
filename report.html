            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Stock price forecasting is a challenging task in financial markets, where volatility and randomness introduce high uncertainty. 
                This study compares models such as LSTM, Time Series Transformer (TST), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and Lag-Llama foundational model
                in predicting Nvidia (NVDA) stock prices. Additionally, the Stock Investment Analysis Agent in our first tab is designed to provide deeper insight for users.

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset consists of historical daily stock prices for NVIDIA (NVDA), focusing on the closing price. Models are trained with 
                a prediction horizon of seven days. The dataset is preprocessed using MinMax normalization.<br>
                I did EDA first to compare the pattern of Nvidia Stock data and AMD Stock data, and then uses RMSE for deterministic forecasts, CRPS for probabilistic forecasts as metrics.

            <h2>Explanation of Stock Analysis Agent</h2>
            <p>
                I built an AI agent using Dify to analyze U.S. stock market trends, using real-time data from Yahoo Finance and OpenAI's 4o large language models.<br>
                With my personalized design of prompt and workflow, this agent could provide insights into stock performance and recommendations.

            <h2>Results and Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The results of Model Comparison indicate that among the tested models, the LSTM model performs the worst, with RMSE = 16.2018, while the Time Series Transformer performs the best with RMSE = 5.4467.<br>
                Future work can explore hybrid approaches combining LLM-based forecasting with traditional deep learning models.
